# mini-neural-net
This is a small python neural network library that allows for the creation of dense networks with layer specific activation functions.

The library was validated using the EMNIST handwritten numbers dataset. To install the dataset, run `pip install emnist`.

Running the `mnist_net.py` file will train a network on the dataset, and allow the user to handwrite number that will then be classified by the network.
